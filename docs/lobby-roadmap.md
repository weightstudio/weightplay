# Wonder Game Lobby Roadmap

## Current Direction

Wonder Game Lobby is the main website. Wonder Crash is now the first playable game inside the lobby, and future games should be added as separate entries instead of replacing the lobby.

## Website Structure

```txt
/
  index.html
  src/lobby-data.js
  src/lobby.js
  games/
    wonder-crash/
      index.html
```

## Game Card Rule

Add or update lobby games in `src/lobby-data.js`.

Each game should define:

- `id`
- `title`
- `status`: `playable` or `planned`
- `type`
- `ages`
- `ageLabel`
- `description`
- `meta`
- `art`
- `href` when playable

## Age Groups

- `3`: toddler and early child
- `6`: elementary child
- `9`: advanced elementary
- `12`: teen and challenge games
- `family`: parent-child games

## Next Website Updates

1. Add category filters besides age, such as action, puzzle, reaction, learning, and family.
2. Add a game detail page template for planned games.
3. Add image requests for each planned game after its MVP spec is chosen.
4. Add privacy/contact/about pages before applying serious ad placement.
5. Build the next MVP game: `星星翻翻牌`.

## Released Games

- Wonder Crash: defense and upgrade game for ages 6+.
- 顏色便當盒: color matching game for ages 3+ and family play.

## PM Notes

Keep new games small. Every first version should have one core mechanic, one game screen, one result screen, mobile controls, and a fast restart.
